# **Shiftly — Minimalistic Typing Speed Game**

Shiftly is a lightweight, distraction-free typing speed test built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
It generates a continuous stream of words and measures how fast and accurately you can type within a selected time duration.

No frameworks. No dependencies. Just a clean UI and smooth typing experience.

## **📸 User Interface Overview**

- Displays a continuous stream of words in a clean layout
- Highlights current word and letter being typed
- Shows countdown timer during gameplay
- Presents WPM score when time expires
- Displays score history of last 5 attempts

## **🎮 How to Play**

1. Open the website (`index.html`) in your browser
2. Choose a timer duration (30 / 60 / 120 / 180 seconds)
3. Click on the game area to start (keyboard will auto-focus)
4. Type the words exactly as shown on screen
5. Press **space** after each word to move to the next
6. Use **backspace** to correct mistakes
7. When time ends, your WPM score is displayed and saved

## **🧠 How It Works (Under the Hood)**

### **Word Stream**
The JS file contains a large paragraph of text, cleaned and split into words:

```javascript
const words =
  "The orange clock rested beside a notebook filled with..." 
    .replace(/[.,—–!?'"""]/g, "")  // Remove punctuation
    .split(/\s+/);                  // Split by whitespace
```

### **Infinite Word Generation**
Words are dynamically appended as you type, ensuring you never run out:

```javascript
// Checks every 3 keystrokes if more words are needed
if (containerBottom - cursorTop < 300) {
  appendWords(50);  // Adds 50 more words
}
```

### **Game Timer**

```javascript
const options = [30, 60, 120, 180];  // Timer options in seconds
let gameTime = 30 * 1000;            // Default: 30 seconds
```

### **Gameplay Flow**
1. Timer starts when user begins typing
2. Letters are marked as correct (green) or incorrect (red)
3. Words auto-scroll as you progress
4. WPM is calculated based on correctly typed words
5. Score is saved to localStorage for history tracking

### **WPM Calculation**

```javascript
WPM = (correctWords / gameTime) * 60000
```

## **🎨 Customization**

### **Modify Timer Options**
In `main.js`:

```javascript
const options = [30, 60, 120, 180];  // Add or remove values
```

### **Customize Word List**
Change the paragraph at the top of `main.js`:

```javascript
const words = "your custom text here"
  .replace(/[.,—–!?'"""]/g, "")
  .split(/\s+/);
```

### **Adjust Word Generation**
Modify how many words are initially loaded and dynamically added:

```javascript
// In newGame()
appendWords(100);  // Initial word count

// In infinite scroll check
appendWords(50);   // Words added each time
```

### **Styling**
All UI layout and visuals are in `style.css` — easy to customize colors, fonts, and spacing.
